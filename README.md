## Introduction
The demand for Next.js 13 applications peaked! Now is the perfect time to build a state-of-the-art modern application that leverages all of the latest and greatest of what Next 13 has to offer, leveraging features such as server-side rendering and the app router. 
 
Alongside building this application:

- Created Filtering Capabilities
- Optimized Metadata and SEO
- Created custom filter, combobox, and modal elements
- Maintained a well-organized file and folder structure.
- Embraced the principles of writing clean code.
